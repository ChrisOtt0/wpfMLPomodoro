MLB's first-ever wild-card series weekend concluded with just one Game 3: the San Diego Padres at New York Mets.

And unfortunately for New York's postseason hopes, the Padres of Game 1 showed up. San Diego shut out the Mets 6-0 to move on to a date with 
the Los Angeles Dodgers in the next round.

The playoff field expanded to 12 teams for the 2022 postseason -- four best-of-three series to determine which teams will advance to the ALDS 
(against the Houston Astros or the New York Yankees) and NLDS (against the Atlanta Braves or Dodgers).

Well, all but one of the wild-card series ended in a sweep. The Cleveland Guardians swept the Tampa Bay Rays and will meet the Yankees in the next round. 
The Seattle Mariners swept the Toronto Blue Jays and will move on to face the Astros. And the Philadelphia Phillies will battle the Braves after 
sweeping the St. Louis Cardinals.

Below is all the action from the final day of the Wild Card, including our experts' pregame picks, in-game highlights and post-game takeaways.

Simply put, Joe Musgrove shut down the Mets -- and the New York lineup had no answer. Throughout the evening, Musgrove was in complete control, 
allowing just one hit while walking one and striking out five batters. Complete and utter domination. Meanwhile, the Padres took advantage of 
some early shakiness from Chris Bassitt, with a second-inning Austin Nola single knocking in Josh Bell and Ha-Seong Kim and a fourth inning 
single from Trent Grisham scoring Kim again. Bassitt certainly didn't look bad, but on an evening where Musgrove looked as good as he's ever pitched, 
the Mets starter had very little room for error and the Padres took advantage of every opportunity. -- Joon Lee
