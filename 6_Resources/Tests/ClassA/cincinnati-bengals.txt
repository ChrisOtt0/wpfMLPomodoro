With their 19-17 victory, the Ravens move to 3-2 on the season and claim sole possession of first place in the AFC North, 
while Cincinnati slip back to 2-3.

Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow had given his side the lead for the first time in the game with a one-yard scoring plunge 
with just under two minutes to go, but that was enough time for Baltimore to drive into field goal range and set things up for Tucker, 
who had earlier been successful from 58 yards with a kick in the third quarter.

Tucker's game-winner was just a routing 43-yarder and extended his streak to 61-straight successful field goals in the fourth quarter and overtime.
Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson shook off a rough night passing, expertly leading the Ravens down the field on the final drive.

Baltimore have blown leads of 21 and 17 points already in their previous two home games this season, when losing to the Miami Dolphins and 
Buffalo Bills, respectively. They squandered a 10-point advantage in this one but recovered late on to claim the victory.
The Ravens' defense also managed to keep Burrow and Cincinnati star receiver JaMarr Chase mostly under control and pulled off an impressive 
stand in the third quarter, keeping them out of the endzone when the visitors were first-and-goal from the two-yard line.

The Bengals trailed 13-10 when they wasted that opportunity. A further Tucker field goal then extended Baltimore's lead to six, 
before Burrow's late TD finally nudged the Bengals ahead, only for the Ravens' kicker to have the final say.
Earlier, in the first half, Mark Andrews scored an 11-yard touchdown to put Baltimore 10-0 up, before fellow tight end and former team-mate 
Hayden Hurst hauled in Cincinnati's first score of the game on a 19-yard grab later in the second quarter.
