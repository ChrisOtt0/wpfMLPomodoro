Cristiano Ronaldo came on for Anthony Martial against Everton to score the 700th goal of his club career. 
but the substitution could have even greater implications. Ronaldo is finding it hard to get opportunities in the Manchester United team, 
but another injury to Martial makes it even less likely he will be allowed to leave Old Trafford in January.

Erik ten Hag is wary of leaving himself short of options during the most hectic season he has ever had to navigate, and he can't rely on Martial 
to be available regularly. The Frenchman has already missed games this season because of hamstring and Achilles injuries, and Ten Hag can't leave 
himself in a situation where Marcus Rashford is the only fit striker in his squad.

If Martial can't stay injury-free, Ronaldo's move away will have to wait until at least the end of the season -- Dawson

The Premier League season is not even 25% played, but Liverpool's hopes of a second title under Jurgen Klopp already look remote. Sunday's 3-2 
defeat at Arsenal left them 14 points adrift of the Gunners with the fact they have a game in hand offering only a glimmer of hope a desperate 
situation can be rescued. They are 13 points behind favourites Manchester City and even 10 behind Tottenham Hotspur, who have largely failed to 
convince this season but still occupy third place.

There is still time for Liverpool to rescue their league campaign, and few would doubt this group of players was capable of putting together a 
winning run to put them back in the picture, but Klopp admitted the gravity of their plight when speaking on Sunday 
night: "We're not in the race ... we're in a tough moment and we want to get through this together and that's what we are working on."

It already feels as though time is against them. -- Olley
