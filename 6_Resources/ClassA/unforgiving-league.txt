NEW YORK — Chris Bassitt cupped his hand over his ear and shook his head in confusion, seemingly mouthing, “Which one?”

The problem was the PitchCom, a new development in baseball this season. The visual signs put down by catchers for generations had proven 
vulnerable to nefarious illegal observation, and so they’d ditched the analog system for something that couldn’t be seen. Now, catchers press 
buttons on a wristband to trigger a small bone-conduction earpiece in the pitcher’s hat to suggest a certain pitch. Auditory communication, 
instead of visual.

The system was rolled out in spring training to such positive reviews that it was basically ubiquitous by the end of the regular season. 
Spring training games, though, are notably relaxed while win-or-go-home postseason games in New York are … not.

In the second inning of such a game against the San Diego Padres, Bassitt seemed to struggle to hear the pitch call over the audible angst of a 
crowd that had waited six years to see a postseason, seven to see their team advance.

Fortunately for the technology’s reputation and unfortunately for Bassitt and the fans, the problem did not persist. The Padres scored two in 
the inning, silencing the Citi Field crowd. Later, they would chant “cheater” — more on that in a minute — but mostly remained subdued as 
Joe Musgrove quieted the Mets’ bats and the Padres rolled to a 6-0 victory and a division series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
And after spending 176 days in first place during the regular season, the Mets, meanwhile, will be left with plenty of time to consider what 
went wrong.

Oddly enough, that was not even the most notable ear-related moment of the game.
